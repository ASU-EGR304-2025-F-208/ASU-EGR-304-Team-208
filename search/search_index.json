It helped me find small leaks, shut off water left on overnight, and recently alerted me to a failing Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV). With its pressure alerts and historical graphs, I saw our water pressure often exceeded 100 psi and fixed the PRV, preventing costly damage. While it sometimes misidentifies leaks and shuts off water unnecessarily, this can be improved with better setup. Overall, it\u2019s definitely worth having. Ability to detect and alert (explicit); Accurate alerts (explicit); Long term savings (latent) The Kidde/Carrier detector is easy to set up, integrates with the app and smart assistants, and is affordable with reliable quality. It has loud alarms, app-based controls, and simple installation. However, the AA batteries last only about a year, nuisance alarms can only be hushed on the same Wi-Fi network, and it\u2019s limited to indoor use. Easy Set up (explicit); Affordable (explicit); Long-term reliability (latent) This Frizzlife water shutoff valve is well-built, integrates smoothly with SmartHome/Tuya, and is easy to install. The app works reliably, customer support was responsive, and documentation is clear. It takes about 20 seconds to fully close but seals completely and offers configurable leak detection. The unit also allows swapping inlet/outlet sides easily. App Reliability (explicit); Straightforward setup and instructions (explicit); Customer Support (latent) These models were easy to set up and didn\u2019t take up too much space. Device setup is a 5-10 step process before it starts working. The device isn\u2019t a complete eyesore. Size can cause the device to not fit in some areas. Compact and user-friendly setup (latent); Fits in most spaces (latent) An inexpensive way to prevent a lot of repair costs, since it catches leaks before they become bigger issues. Integrates easily with other devices, making it a better package overall. Cost-effective protection (latent); Easy integration with other devices (latent) This device has proved to be very valuable in our home. It\u2019s helped identify multiple small leaks, shut off water when things were left on overnight, and helped identify a failing PRV. Sends high pressure alerts and provides historic graphs of flow-rate and water pressure. Detect leaks and send alerts (explicit); Track water pressure and flow to prevent damage (explicit); Allow configurable alerts to reduce false alarms (latent) This is a great product although as a new install I don\u2019t know how it will hold up over time.

Took a little bit to install, and get it right but that was more user error than anything. It would be nice if they offered a longer sensor cord as I wanted to use that for our hot water heater which was in another room, but can use an audio extension cable to extend the reach or splice the cord. Also, no way to mount the control box, but heavy-duty Velcro worked very well. Mount for product (explicit); Longer power cord (explicit); Easy Installation (latent) This both an ALARM and SHUT OFF, direct electrical (battery is optional) unit, does NOT work. There was substantial plumbing expense to link and attach plumbing (shut on &amp; off) valve. Tested immediately. Sensors were easily activated when touched by hand (humidity). Quickly resolved by wearing gloves. Three (3) days later THIS product was RANDOMLY setting alarm in and shutting water valve Off. This again and again, despite following instructions to the letter RESETTING and opening the water valve. The UNIT Repeatedly ALARMED &amp; shut OFF water constantly Reliable Sensors (explicit); Dependable Functionality (explicit); Peace of Mind (latent) Very useful device particularly for a remote home. I have these devices all over two homes. In one of the homes I also have the water shut off valve. Having once experienced a broken toilet that cost $66,000 in insured losses I'm keen to head off problems before they get out of hand. My only concern was it is a bit tedious to set up a lot of these at once, I wish it was easier to do the WiFi setup. Part of this is that their serial numbers used in WiFi setup are unnecessarily complex and the type is very small on labels. Dependable protection from leaks and peace of mind (explicit); Easier and more user-friendly Wi-Fi setup (explicit); Trustworthy product (latent) False alarms when there is no water. The device does not beep at false negatives, causing issues with reliability. Frustrations in hearing beeps when there is no reason for them to be heard. Can result in battery replacement when the device still has perfectly fine batteries. A weak battery means constant replacement. Constant battery changes can result in the price for upkeep being too high to be justifiable. Reduce false alarms (explicit); Minimize battery replacement (explicit); Improve reliability (latent) I have had my Flume 2 for two years now. Works great- but lowering stars due to Flume\u2019s changing the replacement battery to \u201cproprietary\u201d. My original pack lasted two years. Field reports indicate these cells last far less than the factory Everready cells that came in my original Flume2. Long-lasting, user-replaceable batteries (explicit); Sustainable design (latent) First, I LOVE the FLUME 2, when it worked. The first unit I received worked for 12 hrs- then it lost connection between the Bridge and the sensor. Needed to escalate to get replacement unit. Accurate water usage tracking (explicit); Quick, reliable connection (explicit); Responsive customer support (latent) Great concept, when first bought this 3 pack, setup was easy. Forward a year later, multiple email alerts of water by main, but sensor at sump pump never went off. Detect leaks reliably (explicit); Send timely alerts (explicit); Maintain consistent long-term performance (latent) Buyer beware! Bought two units based on reviews. Impossible to connect to Wi-Fi, partial refund issue. Simple, reliable Wi-Fi setup (explicit); Fair, hassle-free returns (explicit); Transparent, trustworthy experience (latent) Device constantly goes offline. Notifications once a week, requiring reset. App alarm not sufficient at night.

In recent months, he has noticed that his water bill has increased substantially. He notes that nothing about his household's consumption habits has changed, and he suspects a leak but doesn\u2019t know where to start. Numerous points in his home could be the source of a leak, and rather than replacing the piping or manually checking all of his appliances, he needs a tool that can automatically detect varying pressure and usage for him. By utilizing a water primary sensor, he sees that his water usage rises drastically when he runs his shower, then lowers when turned off, but remains well above no flow. He determined that the shower pipes that extended from the main line must have caused the leak and hired a plumber to replace those pipes. Ultimately, he has saved hundreds of dollars in diagnostic costs and repairs to pipes that are not the root cause of the leak. </p> <p>Before leaving the house, James starts the dishwasher one afternoon. He has been away for several hours when his new water sensor system detects water pressure dropping quickly. Recognizing this as a significant leak, the system can shut off the water and prevent further kitchen flooding. James is alerted to this leak and shutoff process and returns home to clean up. Since the system alerted him to the leak and source, he can purchase a new dishwasher.</p> <p>User Story #2: Donna Recently, Donna had a faulty door lock mechanism on her washer that caused severe flooding in her garage. This damaged several valuable tools underneath her workbench and took several hours to clean up thoroughly. After calling a technician to fix the lock, she still has concerns over flooding caused by her washer and the adjacent water heater. She installs a water leak detector with an adjustable alarm system to give her peace of mind and mitigate potential damage. In the following weeks, a small drip causes an accumulation of water that rises an eighth of an inch in the flood pan that the washer sits in. Upon detecting this buildup, the system shuts off the water to the washer and sets off the alarm. Given the location of the washer in the garage, Donna had set the alarm level to the high setting and could hear it from across the house. This allowed her to promptly replace the washer and prevent water from reaching her valuables again. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"Req ID Category Requirement Verification Method(s) Priority 1 Functionality The product shall run off batteries so it doesn\u2019t fail during a power outage.

To avoid confusion this was facilitated by each group member working on separate sections of the features table. The group then reconvened to discuss additional points to come to the total of 100 unique features and needs of the user. Each major user need was established in the table to start, and after they had been filled out with 8-10 needs each other auxiliary features were added based on freshly created user requirements. These new user requirements included topics pertaining to livability with the product, safety and smart system features. To complete this portion of the assignment the group met through a zoom session lasting approximately an hour and a half. The methodology of this meeting was to maintain an appropriate spread of work across the group in a democratic fashion. The bulk of the unique features came from the Product Requirements team assignment while the other new requirements added were derived from important subsets of some of these sections. In order to generate these features from the user needs each member of the group conducted broad research on sensors, typical construction and battery type among other facets of water leak detection systems. Generative AI was not used in any part of this brainstorming session and all features either came from preestablished products or through group discussion. Certain outlandish or more design intensive features were added after group discussion when an individual presented them. The features included in the table sought to address common issues, and praise, that customers voiced in online reviews.  The delegation of certain tasks was decided collectively. Each team member was given a task relating to sketching the concept and documenting the design ideation process. Greater freedom was given to the individual members of the team with how to express the ideas selected for sketches. After the sketches were presented to the group additional formatting of the sorting and ranking section took place and the documentation process began.  The grouping of features in the table were kept to the category of the user needs they fell under, i.e. durable construction and waterproof design. The listing of features within user need groupings were kept in a chronological order of when they were added. This will help illustrate which features are most intuitive, useful and effective when beginning to design the product. In order to bring about a varied and consistent range of concepts the most recurring issues to address were acknowledged. These fall closely inline with the product requirements and include concerns such as the storage of power in the device, prevention of water from entering the circuit, type of sensor used to detect water and type of alert given to the user when water is detected. From this point an additional set of features were selected to increase positive user experience; bluetooth, OLED panels and configurable decibel levels were added to improve user satisfaction. Other aspects of the design relating to construction material were varied across concepts to provide options for a later point. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Bold Text Italic Text Bold and Italic Text</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#research-question","title":"Research Question","text":"<ul> <li>Bullet Point 1</li> <li>Bullet Point 2</li> <li>Bullet Point 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#images","title":"Images","text":"<p> Figure 2: Early PCB working design</p> <p> Figure 3: Innovation Showcase Spring '25, where the products were a STEM-themed display that demonstrates a single scientific/engineering concept with the intended user of K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math.</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#conclusions-and-future-work","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#results_1","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#conclusions-and-future-work_1","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#external-links_1","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/","title":"Software Proposal","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Bold Text Italic Text Bold and Italic Text</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#research-question","title":"Research Question","text":"<ul> <li>Bullet Point 1</li> <li>Bullet Point 2</li> <li>Bullet Point 3</li> </ul>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#images","title":"Images","text":"<p> Figure 2: Early PCB working design</p> <p> Figure 3: Innovation Showcase Spring '25, where the products were a STEM-themed display that demonstrates a single scientific/engineering concept with the intended user of K-12 students interested in learning about science, technology, engineering, or math.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#results","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#conclusions-and-future-work","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#external-links","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#results_1","title":"Results","text":"<ol> <li>Numbered Point 1</li> <li>Numbered Point 2</li> <li>Numbered Point 3</li> </ol>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#conclusions-and-future-work_1","title":"Conclusions and Future Work","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#external-links_1","title":"External Links","text":"<p>example link to idealab</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Proposal/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/","title":"Appendix: Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<ol> <li>Creating a product that can withstand more then just a few uses.</li> <li>Making a user experience that is usable by most indviduals.</li> <li>Documenting our steps during development to keep track of where the project is currently at.</li> <li>Communicating at every step of the process</li> <li>Keeping each other in sync as we work so no one indvidual is left behind</li> </ol>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#communication-channels","title":"Communication Channels","text":"<p>Appendix Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes</p> Name First Choice Communication Second Choice Communication Third Choice Communication Cristopher Echeverria Group chat Voice call In person Khalid Hamdam Group chat Voice call In person Julian Mitchell Group chat Voice call In person Elisabeth Sabbagh Group chat Voice call In person","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#main-method-for-group-communication","title":"Main Method for Group Communication","text":"<p>The primary method for group communication is through our group text chat.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#communication-procedures","title":"Communication Procedures","text":"<ol> <li>Team members if they need to communicate a issue or plan change, other will respond.
