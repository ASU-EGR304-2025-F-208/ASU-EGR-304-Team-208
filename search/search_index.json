In recent months, he has noticed that his water bill has increased substantially. He notes that nothing about his household's consumption habits has changed, and he suspects a leak but doesn\u2019t know where to start. Numerous points in his home could be the source of a leak, and rather than replacing the piping or manually checking all of his appliances, he needs a tool that can automatically detect varying pressure and usage for him. By utilizing a water primary sensor, he sees that his water usage rises drastically when he runs his shower, then lowers when turned off, but remains well above no flow. He determined that the shower pipes that extended from the main line must have caused the leak and hired a plumber to replace those pipes. Ultimately, he has saved hundreds of dollars in diagnostic costs and repairs to pipes that are not the root cause of the leak. </p> <p>Before leaving the house, James starts the dishwasher one afternoon. He has been away for several hours when his new water sensor system detects water pressure dropping quickly. Recognizing this as a significant leak, the system can shut off the water and prevent further kitchen flooding. James is alerted to this leak and shutoff process and returns home to clean up. Since the system alerted him to the leak and source, he can purchase a new dishwasher.</p> <p>User Story #2: Donna Recently, Donna had a faulty door lock mechanism on her washer that caused severe flooding in her garage. This damaged several valuable tools underneath her workbench and took several hours to clean up thoroughly. After calling a technician to fix the lock, she still has concerns over flooding caused by her washer and the adjacent water heater. She installs a water leak detector with an adjustable alarm system to give her peace of mind and mitigate potential damage. In the following weeks, a small drip causes an accumulation of water that rises an eighth of an inch in the flood pan that the washer sits in. Upon detecting this buildup, the system shuts off the water to the washer and sets off the alarm. Given the location of the washer in the garage, Donna had set the alarm level to the high setting and could hear it from across the house. This allowed her to promptly replace the washer and prevent water from reaching her valuables again. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"Req ID Category Requirement Verification Method(s) Priority 1 Functionality The product shall run off batteries so it doesn\u2019t fail during a power outage.

To avoid confusion this was facilitated by each group member working on separate sections of the features table. The group then reconvened to discuss additional points to come to the total of 100 unique features and needs of the user. Each major user need was established in the table to start, and after they had been filled out with 8-10 needs each other auxiliary features were added based on freshly created user requirements. These new user requirements included topics pertaining to livability with the product, safety and smart system features. To complete this portion of the assignment the group met through a zoom session lasting approximately an hour and a half. The methodology of this meeting was to maintain an appropriate spread of work across the group in a democratic fashion.</p> <p>The bulk of the unique features came from the Product Requirements team assignment while the other new requirements added were derived from important subsets of some of these sections. In order to generate these features from the user needs each member of the group conducted broad research on sensors, typical construction and battery type among other facets of water leak detection systems. Generative AI was not used in any part of this brainstorming session and all features either came from preestablished products or through group discussion. Certain outlandish or more design intensive features were added after group discussion when an individual presented them. The features included in the table sought to address common issues, and praise, that customers voiced in online reviews.  The delegation of certain tasks was decided collectively. Each team member was given a task relating to sketching the concept and documenting the design ideation process. Greater freedom was given to the individual members of the team with how to express the ideas selected for sketches. After the sketches were presented to the group additional formatting of the sorting and ranking section took place and the documentation process began. </p> <p>The grouping of features in the table were kept to the category of the user needs they fell under, i.e. durable construction and waterproof design. The listing of features within user need groupings were kept in a chronological order of when they were added. This will help illustrate which features are most intuitive, useful and effective when beginning to design the product. In order to bring about a varied and consistent range of concepts the most recurring issues to address were acknowledged. These fall closely inline with the product requirements and include concerns such as the storage of power in the device, prevention of water from entering the circuit, type of sensor used to detect water and type of alert given to the user when water is detected. From this point an additional set of features were selected to increase positive user experience; bluetooth, OLED panels and configurable decibel levels were added to improve user satisfaction. Other aspects of the design relating to construction material were varied across concepts to provide options for a later point. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#water-detection-system-team-subsystem-overview","title":"Water Detection System \u2014 Team Subsystem Overview","text":"<p>This page showcases the team's subsystems designed and built by each team member, which together form a complete, coordinated water detection system.

Julian's spoke is a pressure system built into a water pipeline to check that the water is at the right level. Cristopher measures the humidity and temperature of the area where the device is placed. Lastly, Elisabeth's detector detects the presence of water. If any sensor gives a value that is too high, the signal is then sent to Khalid, and the alarm goes off. With all of these systems in place, it allows the final product ot be a versatile water leak sensor suited for any place in a house, as it will detect any water, and inform the homeowner immediately of its presence.</p> <p>Note: You can download the Hub-and-Spoke diagram as a PNG</p> <p>Reminder: Every subsystem has a different function, and all team contributions come together to form the complete system.</p>"},{"location":"07-Team%20Software%20Design/","title":"Team Software Design","text":""},{"location":"07-Team%20Software%20Design/#system-flow-overview","title":"System Flow Overview","text":"<p>The diagram illustrates the core operation of the Water Detection Subsystem.

It's better to have larger pads than needed so that the solder can be placed appropriately on the board.</li> <li>Traces at 45-degree angles, while not the craziest thing taught in the course. It is just good practice, and it builds when it comes to PCB design, even if the rule is mostly just for something like high amperage.</li> <li>Other good practice things like having ground/negative always facing down, or voltage facing up. It both makes creating schematics easier and reading them easier.</li> <li>Using headers and jumpers in a PCB as test points, along with being failsafes. It makes it a lot easier to design proto boards with failsafes like these when they are already added in from the get-go as spare headers or jumpers. So instead of always having to look for a spare, you have them on the schematic from the get-go.</li> <li>Using UaRT systems to print data into a program like PuTTY directly. This skill came in real handy when debugging code if you only have one variable, as it constantly shows its value.</li> <li>Learning to use tools like the oscilloscope. A valuable skill when working with analog devices, as it provides a visual representation of the waveform being produced.</li> <li>How to calculate the value of a fuse that should be used in a given circuit based on a power budget. Along with allowing for a margin of safety of around 20%. A skill that will be used for years to come.</li> <li>Checking if the parts you order have good data sheets. It's just a good test to see if the part will be usable and not a nightmare to work with.</li> <li>Update living documents constantly. It helps in the long run, as when a final report is required, there is no rush to change everything, so it remains up to date.
