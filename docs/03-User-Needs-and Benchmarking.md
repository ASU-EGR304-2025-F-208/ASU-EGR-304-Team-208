### POSITIVE COMMENTS
| **Voice of the Customer** | **Restated Customer Need** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| This device has been very valuable in our home. It helped me find small leaks, shut off water left on overnight, and recently alerted me to a failing Pressure Reducing Valve (PRV). With its pressure alerts and historical graphs, I saw our water pressure often exceeded 100 psi and fixed the PRV, preventing costly damage. While it sometimes misidentifies leaks and shuts off water unnecessarily, this can be improved with better setup. Overall, it’s definitely worth having. | 1. Ability to detect and alert (explicit) <br> 2. Accurate alerts (explicit) <br> 3. Long-term savings (latent) |

**Repeated and Most Helpful Statements From Positive Reviews:**  
- Ease of use/ Installation  
- Peace of mind  
- Value for money  
- Functionality  
- Specific models were straightforward to set up  
- Gave customers peace of mind by just working  
- Integrates easily with other devices, making it a better package overall  
- An inexpensive way to prevent a lot of repair costs, since it catches leaks before they become bigger issues  
- Compact size made it easier to set up  
- Great for spotting leaks and pressure issues, even caught a bad valve. Some false alarms but worth it.  
- Works great! Lets you check anytime and email test results.  
- Good sensors, but AA/AAA batteries would be cheaper.  
- Great product with helpful info, setup was complicated but easy battery replacement.  
- Access to historical data has been helpful in identifying water consumption and inefficiencies. — Moen  
- Alerts are immediate and timely while offering a loud noise to indicate an issue. — Switchbot  
- The valve operator comes with adapters, clamps and rings to better fit your water main’s construction — Yolink  
- Clearly labeled parts, app instructions and versatile parts make for an easy installation — Metak  
- Communication on a main hub/app that displays low battery life and other states makes usability high — Metak  

**Repeated and Most Helpful Statements From Negative Reviews:**  
- Connection/ App Issues  
- Tedious to set up (especially for products w/multiple sensors)  
- Build quality  
- Battery runs out quick (for products who use batteries)  
- False alarms when there is no water  
- A weak battery means constant replacement  
- The app for the device is not user-friendly  
- The alarm itself is far too quiet  
- Installation was complicated for some models  
- Flume 2 works but the pricey battery pack is wasteful and short-lived. No signal strength tool, first unit failed, though support replaced it.  
- 16 of 18 sensors died in under a day. Setup is tedious, only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and other brands offer more.  
- Plumber installed it, but the valve wouldn’t connect, the app was slow, and support didn’t help. Returned it.  
- Worked at first, but later failed to detect a flood and now won’t reconnect.  
- There is a lack of clarity on where to install sensors from the manufacturer and professional consults. — Moen  
- Sensors on the device are relatively sensitive and can be set off with a small puddle if not a small drop of water — Yolink  
- The cost of replacement for the sensors is quite pricey — FloodStop  
- Not compatible with certain Wi-Fi setups (5 MHz) — Metak  
- Default settings without adjustment can create false triggers that have to be addressed in 5 minutes or water can potentially shut off. Such false triggers could include taking a shower — Moen
