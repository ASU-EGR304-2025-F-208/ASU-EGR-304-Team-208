    **Repeated and Most Helpful Statements From Positive Reviews:**  
- Ease of use/ Installation  
- Peace of mind  
- Value for money  
- Functionality  
- Specific models were straightforward to set up  
- Gave customers peace of mind by just working  
- Integrates easily with other devices, making it a better package overall  
- An inexpensive way to prevent a lot of repair costs, since it catches leaks before they become bigger issues  
- Compact size made it easier to set up  
- Great for spotting leaks and pressure issues, even caught a bad valve. Some false alarms but worth it.  
- Works great! Lets you check anytime and email test results.  
- Good sensors, but AA/AAA batteries would be cheaper.  
- Great product with helpful info, setup was complicated but easy battery replacement.  
- Access to historical data has been helpful in identifying water consumption and inefficiencies. — Moen  
- Alerts are immediate and timely while offering a loud noise to indicate an issue. — Switchbot  
- The valve operator comes with adapters, clamps and rings to better fit your water main’s construction — Yolink  
- Clearly labeled parts, app instructions and versatile parts make for an easy installation — Metak  
- Communication on a main hub/app that displays low battery life and other states makes usability high — Metak  

**Repeated and Most Helpful Statements From Negative Reviews:**  
- Connection/ App Issues  
- Tedious to set up (especially for products w/multiple sensors)  
- Build quality  
- Battery runs out quick (for products who use batteries)  
- False alarms when there is no water  
- A weak battery means constant replacement  
- The app for the device is not user-friendly  
- The alarm itself is far too quiet  
- Installation was complicated for some models  
- Flume 2 works but the pricey battery pack is wasteful and short-lived. No signal strength tool, first unit failed, though support replaced it.  
- 16 of 18 sensors died in under a day. Setup is tedious, only works on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and other brands offer more.  
- Plumber installed it, but the valve wouldn’t connect, the app was slow, and support didn’t help. Returned it.  
- Worked at first, but later failed to detect a flood and now won’t reconnect.  
- There is a lack of clarity on where to install sensors from the manufacturer and professional consults. — Moen  
- Sensors on the device are relatively sensitive and can be set off with a small puddle if not a small drop of water — Yolink  
- The cost of replacement for the sensors is quite pricey — FloodStop  
- Not compatible with certain Wi-Fi setups (5 MHz) — Metak  
- Default settings without adjustment can create false triggers that have to be addressed in 5 minutes or water can potentially shut off. Such false triggers could include taking a shower — Moen
