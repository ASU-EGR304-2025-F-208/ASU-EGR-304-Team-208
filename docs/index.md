## Team Introduction
Our team consists of four engineering students from Arizona State University’s Polytechnic campus. We are currently designing and developing a comprehensive water leak detection system that utilizes multiple sensors — including a pressure sensor, a puddle sensor, and a humidity/temperature sensor.

Each sensor continuously monitors different environmental conditions and sends data to the main control subsystem, which triggers an alarm whenever a potential water leak is detected.

This system is designed to give users peace of mind by providing early detection and alerts for both large leaks and small, hard-to-notice leaks. By identifying issues before they cause damage, our solution helps prevent costly water damage and protect valuable property.
