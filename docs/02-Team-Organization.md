## Team Charter
> At JECK™, we believe in creating simple and durable devices that assist with everyday life. This starts with ensuring the user experience is as straightforward as possible—no need for ridiculously long instructions. Ideally, all the customer should need to do is install the product and turn it on. We also strive to make our products versatile.

## Product Mission Statement

Our leak detection device is designed to save homeowners money in the long term by alerting them whenever a leak occurs. Additionally, we aim to provide peace of mind by ensuring that even areas of the house that aren’t frequently checked are still protected from disaster.
