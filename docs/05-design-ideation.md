## Documented Work

The brainstorming process was an equal part collaboration between all members of the team. To avoid confusion this was facilitated by each group member working on separate sections of the features table. The group then reconvened to discuss additional points to come to the total of 100 unique features and needs of the user. Each major user need was established in the table to start, and after they had been filled out with 8-10 needs each other auxiliary features were added based on freshly created user requirements. These new user requirements included topics pertaining to livability with the product, safety and smart system features. To complete this portion of the assignment the group met through a zoom session lasting approximately an hour and a half. The methodology of this meeting was to maintain an appropriate spread of work across the group in a democratic fashion.
The bulk of the unique features came from the Product Requirements team assignment while the other new requirements added were derived from important subsets of some of these sections. In order to generate these features from the user needs each member of the group conducted broad research on sensors, typical construction and battery type among other facets of water leak detection systems. Generative AI was not used in any part of this brainstorming session and all features either came from preestablished products or through group discussion. Certain outlandish or more design intensive features were added after group discussion when an individual presented them. The features included in the table sought to address common issues, and praise, that customers voiced in online reviews. 
The delegation of certain tasks was decided collectively. Each team member was given a task relating to sketching the concept and documenting the design ideation process. Greater freedom was given to the individual members of the team with how to express the ideas selected for sketches. After the sketches were presented to the group additional formatting of the sorting and ranking section took place and the documentation process began. 
The grouping of features in the table were kept to the category of the user needs they fell under, i.e. durable construction and waterproof design. The listing of features within user need groupings were kept in a chronological order of when they were added. This will help illustrate which features are most intuitive, useful and effective when beginning to design the product. In order to bring about a varied and consistent range of concepts the most recurring issues to address were acknowledged. These fall closely inline with the product requirements and include concerns such as the storage of power in the device, prevention of water from entering the circuit, type of sensor used to detect water and type of alert given to the user when water is detected. From this point an additional set of features were selected to increase positive user experience; bluetooth, OLED panels and configurable decibel levels were added to improve user satisfaction. Other aspects of the design relating to construction material were varied across concepts to provide options for a later point.
