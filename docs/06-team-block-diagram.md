# Water Detection System — Team Subsystem Overview

This page showcases the team's subsystems designed and built by each team member, which together form a complete, coordinated water detection system. Each teammate has developed a standalone subsystem using a Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano as the microcontroller, and each subsystem is designed to perform a distinct sensing or actuation function.

The subsystems are connected in a **daisy chain configuration** via a **2×4 IDC female header** using an **8-wire ribbon cable**, enabling smooth coordination and data sharing between boards. This modular design allows each board to operate independently while also integrating seamlessly into the full system.

Below is a diagram of the daisy chain setup to visualize the **connections and data flow** between the individual subsytems:

> **Note:** Every subsystem has a different function, so all team contributions come together to form the complete system.
