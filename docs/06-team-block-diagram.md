# Water Detection System — Team Subsystem Overview

This page showcases the team's subsystems designed and built by each team member, which together form a complete, coordinated water detection system. Each teammate has developed a standalone subsystem using a **Microchip PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano** as the microcontroller, and each subsystem is designed to perform a distinct sensing or actuation function.

The subsystems are now connected in a **hub-and-spoke configuration**, where each board interfaces directly with a central hub. This design simplifies communication and improves modularity.

Below is a diagram of the **hub-and-spoke setup**, visualizing the **connections and data flow** between the individual subsystems:

> **Reminder:** Every subsystem has a different function, and all team contributions come together to form the complete system.
