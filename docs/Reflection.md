### Reflection

## 10 important things learned

- When designing the PCB, give each footprint bigger solder pads than just the minimum. It's better to have larger pads than needed so that the solder can be placed appropriately on the board.
- Traces at 45-degree angles, while not the craziest thing taught in the course. It is just good practice, and it builds when it comes to PCB design, even if the rule is mostly just for something like high amperage.
- Other good practice things like having ground/negative always facing down, or voltage facing up. It both makes creating schematics easier and reading them easier.
- Using headers and jumpers in a PCB as test points, along with being failsafes. It makes it a lot easier to design proto boards with failsafes like these when they are already added in from the get-go as spare headers or jumpers. So instead of always having to look for a spare, you have them on the schematic from the get-go.
- Using UaRT systems to print data into a program like PuTTY directly. This skill came in real handy when debugging code if you only have one variable, as it constantly shows its value.
- Learning to use tools like the oscilloscope. A valuable skill when working with analog devices, as it provides a visual representation of the waveform being produced.
- How to calculate the value of a fuse that should be used in a given circuit based on a power budget. Along with allowing for a margin of safety of around 20%. A skill that will be used for years to come.
- Checking if the parts you order have good data sheets. It's just a good test to see if the part will be usable and not a nightmare to work with.
- Update living documents constantly. It helps in the long run, as when a final report is required, there is no rush to change everything, so it remains up to date. Instead, it's just adding a few extra things or minor tweaks.
- Lastly, sticking to the deadlines of the class. Never assume you have more time, so start working on things early. Always making sure the stuff for the next day is prepared.

## 5 things for the next students

- Use out-of-class time to get help, like office hours. Even if it's a minor issue, consider speaking with a teacher or TAs during that time. It's a lot quicker and easier than waiting to get help during class.
- Always order spare parts. Having spares on hand for when things break is an excellent idea, especially for minor components like resistors and capacitors, since there is a chance Peralta 109 doesn't have any in stock either.
- With your team, decide the rules of your code early. For example, if using analog data, how many bits are you using for it? Or for digital, if one means on or off.
- Make mistakes now, while there is a grade to the class, it's still okay ot make mistakes here and there and learn. That is what the classroom is for, making mistakes that you can't make in the field
- Communicate with your teammates. It's okay not being able to instantly. Additionally, make it clear when you won't be able to attend a meeting because something unexpected has come up.
