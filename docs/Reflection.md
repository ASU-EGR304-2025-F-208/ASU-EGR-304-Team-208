### Reflection

-Lessons Learned: What are the top 10 most important things that your team learned from working on this project? You may use feedback received from the design review and content you discussed in status reports to address this section. (use full sentences, ½ page minimum)
## 10 important things learned

- When designing the pcb, give each foot print bigger solder pads then just he minimum

## 5 things for the next students

- Use out of class time to get help, like office hours. Even if its a minor thing, just go talk with a teacher or TA's during that time. Its a lot quicker and easier then waiting to get the help during class.
- Always order spare parts. Having spares for when things break is a really good idea, especially when it comes to the smaller things like resistors and capcitors since there is a chance Peralta 109 doesn't have any in stock either.
- With your team, decide the rules of your code early. For example, if using analog data, how many bits are you using for it. Or for digital, if 1 means on or off.
- Make mistakes now, while there is a grade to the class, its still oaky ot make mistakes here and there and learn. That is what the classroom is for, making mistakes that you can't out in the field
- Comunicate with your teammates. Its okay not beign able to instantly respond to all messages, but eventually respond to it within a few hours. Along with that, make it clear when you aren't going to make a meeting casue something came up.
