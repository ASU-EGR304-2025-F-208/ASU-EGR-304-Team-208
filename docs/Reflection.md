### Reflection

## 10 important things learned

- When designing the pcb, give each foot print bigger solder pads then just the minimum. Its better to have bigger pads then needed so the solder get properly put on the board.
- Traces at 45 degrees angles, while not the craziest thing taught in the course. It is jsut good practice, and built a good habbit when it comes ot PCB design, even if the rule is mostly just for something like high amperage.
- Other good practice things like having ground/negative always facing down, or voltage facing up. It both makes creating schematics easier, along with reading them easier.
- Using headers and jumpers in a pcb as test points along with being failsafes. It makes a lot easier to design proto boards with failsafes like these when they are already added in from the get go as spare headers or jumpers. So rather then always having to go look where you can fit a spare in, you just have them from the get go on the schematic.
- Using UaRT systems to directly print data into a program like PuTTY. This skill came real in handy when debugging code if you only have 1 variable as it constantly shows it value.
- Learning to use tools like the osciliscope. Just an all around useful skill when working with analog devices as gives a visual of the waveform being produced.
- How to calculate the value of fuse that hsould be used in a given circuit based off of a power budget. Along with allowing for a margin of safety of around 20%. A skill that will be used for years to come.
- Checking if the parts you order have good data sheets. It's jsut a good test to see if the part will be usable and not a nightmare to work with.

## 5 things for the next students

- Use out of class time to get help, like office hours. Even if its a minor thing, just go talk with a teacher or TA's during that time. Its a lot quicker and easier then waiting to get the help during class.
- Always order spare parts. Having spares for when things break is a really good idea, especially when it comes to the smaller things like resistors and capcitors since there is a chance Peralta 109 doesn't have any in stock either.
- With your team, decide the rules of your code early. For example, if using analog data, how many bits are you using for it. Or for digital, if 1 means on or off.
- Make mistakes now, while there is a grade to the class, its still oaky ot make mistakes here and there and learn. That is what the classroom is for, making mistakes that you can't out in the field
- Comunicate with your teammates. Its okay not beign able to instantly respond to all messages, but eventually respond to it within a few hours. Along with that, make it clear when you aren't going to make a meeting casue something came up.
